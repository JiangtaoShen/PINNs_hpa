## ðŸ“– Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive global hyperparameter analysis** of the **vanilla PINNs**, leveraging a large sample base.  

It demonstrates the **critical role of hyperparameter optimization** in improving the performance of the vanilla PINN and employs **functional ANOVA (fANOVA)** to systematically assess the **global importance of each hyperparameter**.  

Furthermore, it constructs **prior knowledge models** and verifies their **accelerating effect on convergence** during hyperparameter optimization (HPO).  

Overall, it provides both **qualitative insights** and **quantitative guidelines** for effective hyperparameter tuning of the vanilla PINNs.
